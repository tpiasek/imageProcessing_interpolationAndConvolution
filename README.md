# imageProcessing_interpolationAndConvolution
Interpolation and convolution techniques implemented for both 1D signals, 2D gray images and 3D color images. Convolution process use filters with different kernels with an option to define new ones. Repository contains tests results with comparison between different interpolation and convolution techniques.
